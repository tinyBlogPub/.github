## Hi there 👋
Welcome to the tinyBlogPub (aka tBP) home.
We aim to create some nice pieces of software we can all use as our social web homes (using all the cool Indie, Fedi, and alike standards we all love).

*HISTORY:* we are/were all users of the brilliant [tinyblog.pub] software. 
Since the main software was abandoned, we started maintaining it (which is still our initial goal).
Then, we started getting excited about new larger moves for the software, which justified a name change.

### Roadmap

- Keep the [tinyblog.pub repo](https://github.com/tinyBlogPub/microblog.pub) usable and close to its roots
- Start the tBP work:
  - Re-architect things using a simple and well-tested Blog at its base.
  - Make it possible to migrate data from microBlog.pub
  - Implement **micropub** as a plugin
  - Implement **federation** as a plugin
  - *what else...?*
